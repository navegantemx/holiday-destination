<h2><a id="Holiday__Destination_0"></a>Holiday Destination - Mexico</h2>
<p>Milestone Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute</p>
<hr>
<p>This project is about a website where people can find the best holiday destination in the country of Mexico for their needs. The website offers diferent options for traveling to 10 best cities destinations in Mexico.<br>
A navigation bar allows moving from four different pages: "Home", "Destinations", "Charts Statistics" and "Contact".<br>
The "Home" page includes a "Google Map" and a feature that calls on the Google Maps API.<br>
The "Destination" page shows pictures and information links to Wikipedia about those cities in Mexico.
The "Charts Statistics" page has a "Pie Chart" for statistical population.
The "Contact" page email form, allows tourists to submit questions or request information on their travel needs.</p>
<h2><a id="UX_9"></a>UX</h2>
<p>My goal in the design of this project was to get users interested on the most beautiful places in Mexico and be able to choose a travel destination within the site and/or from its sponsors.</p>
<p>A live demo can be found <a href="https://navegantemx.github.io/holiday-destination/">here</a></p>

<h2><a id="Features_22"></a>Features</h2>
<p>This site uses a four pages “Navbar” feature based on "CDNJS" with powered hover effects to be applied to call to actions, buttons, and logos.<br>
This site calls on the Google Maps API .<br>
"EmailJS" is used to send email directly from Javascript<br>
Charts.js is used to create Charts Statistics "Pie Chart"<br>
<p>Features Left to Implement:<br>
I would like to add in the future, tourist attractions information for more cities for different countries in the world .</p>
<h2><a id="Testing_32"></a>Testing</h2>
<p>Use of Google Developer Tools:<br>I executed my Javascript code including jquery in a REPL in the chrome inspector,<br>
by opening the inspector, clicked the button at the bottom left with 3 lines - its tooltip is "show console"<br>
Then typed javascript and pressed enter. Usually I have to go to the Sources tab and click the "pause script execution" button for javascript to get evaluated.
<p>The “Home” section includes a "Google Map" that shows location markers with information windows of the 10 best places to visit in Mexico.<br>
In the “Destinations” section, there are full colored pictures with links to external content like Wikipedia.<br>
This also includes dynamic DOM manipulation buttons to switch out pictures.<br>
In the "Contact" page, if you try to submit the "contact form" with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address.<br>
Furthermore, the ‘required’ attribute is added to all form input fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit.<br>
If all fields are valid, the page will reload. If users want to contacting me, they will have to fill out all fields in order for the form to be submitted.<br>
A "Thank you, will contact you soon!" javascript alert has been added<br>
The main navigation bar is in a grid change color on hover with CSS.</p>
<p>This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.</p>
<p>During the testing phase, the "google maps" map was not always showing, having to refresh the page several times to make it work.  
Fixed this by deleting the "async" property from the "maps.googleapis.com/maps/api".</p>
<h2><a id="Deployment_47"></a>Deployment</h2>
<p>This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.<br>
The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.<br>
In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.</p>
