<h2><a id="Holiday__Destination_0"></a>Holiday Destination - Mexico</h2>
<p>Milestone Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute</p>
<hr>
<p>This project is about a website where people can find the best holiday destination in the country of Mexico for their needs. The website offers diferent options for traveling to 10 best cities destinations in Mexico.<br>
A navigation bar allows moving from three different pages, "Home", "Destination" and "Contact".<br>
The "Home" page includes a feature that calls on the Google Maps API to allow users to look at the best holiday destinations in Mexico. 
The "Destination" page shows pictures and information about those cities in Mexico.
The "Contact" page email form, allows tourists to submit questions or request information on their travel needs.</p>
<h2><a id="UX_9"></a>UX</h2>
<p>My goal in the design of this project was to get users to choose a travel destination from this site and/or from its sponsors.</p>

<h2><a id="Features_22"></a>Features</h2>
<p>This site uses a three pages “Navbar” feature based on "CDNJS" with powered hover effects to be applied to call to actions, buttons, and logos.<br>
This site calls on the Google Maps API .<br>
"EmailJS" is used to send email directly from Javascript<br>
<p>Features Left to Implement:<br>
I would like to add in the future, tourist attractions information to more cities in the world .</p>
<h2><a id="Testing_32"></a>Testing</h2>
<p>The “Home” section includes a "Google Map" that shows the location of the 10 best places to visit in Mexico a .<br>
In the “Destination” section, there are full colored pictures with touristic and history information, as well as external links to complement the user's interest.<br>
Also, If you try to submit the "contact form" with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address.<br>
Furthermore, the ‘required’ attribute is added to all form input fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit.<br>
If all fields are valid, the page will reload. If users want to contacting me, they will have to fill out all fields in order for the form to go through.<br>
Each navigation bar's square is in a grid change color on hover with CSS.</p>
<p>This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.</p>
<p>During the testing phase, the "google maps" map was not always showing, having to refresh the page. 
Fixed this with ???????.</p>
